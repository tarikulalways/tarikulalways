### Hi, I'm Md. Tarikul Islam 👋

### 🚀 About Me
As an ***Expert WordPress Plugin Developer***, I specialize in building robust, scalable, and performance-driven plugins tailored for real-world use. With deep knowledge in ***OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)***, I structure code that's clean, modular, and easy to maintain — ideal for long-term plugin growth and collaboration.

I work extensively with the ***WordPress REST API*** to enable seamless communication between services, and I have strong hands-on experience developing and customizing WooCommerce plugins to extend and enhance eCommerce functionality.

To boost development efficiency and streamline tasks, I utilize WP-CLI, and I’m proud to be an active ***WordPress.org plugin contributor***, having published and maintained plugins for the global WordPress community.

My mission is to create plugins that not only function flawlessly but also follow best practices in security, performance, and UX. Whether it’s a custom solution or a product for the WordPress repository, I build with precision, purpose, and passion.
